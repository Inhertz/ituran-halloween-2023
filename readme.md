Pay attention, all clues require your brains but only the first one can be found within the heart.

Time is your enemy and your lives are at stake. Tic Toc. Play or die, the choice is yours!

## First Game: Jigsaw Puzzle
I want to play a game. You find yourself trapped in a room, and the only way to escape is by completing a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces of this puzzle are scattered throughout the room, but they are not ordinary pieces. Each piece represents a choice you've made in your life, a piece of your own history.

To solve this puzzle and earn your freedom, you must first reflect on your past. Examine each piece carefully, for they hold the key to your salvation. As you piece together your own story, you will discover the path to unlock the door and escape your own personal prison.

## Second Game: Bluelight
Hello, seeker of truth. You now stand at a crossroads between deception and revelation. In this dimly lit room, a whiteboard with a concealed message will be your salvation or your demise. The truth you seek can only be uncovered through the secrets of this room.

A conventional glance at the whiteboard will reveal a false message, leading you astray. But within the shadows, hidden from the naked eye, lies the real message. You must discover the means to unveil it.

Observe your surroundings carefully, for the tools you need to reveal the hidden truth are within your grasp. Your path to freedom lies in deciphering the riddle concealed in plain sight.

## Third Game: Old Phone
Your destiny now hangs in the balance, and you stand before an ancient device that holds the key to your escape. In your hand, you hold an old phone, a relic of the past. This phone is not an ordinary one; it's a cryptic gateway to your salvation.

Unlocking your freedom depends on your ability to decipher the hidden message within this phone. You have the number "3948," but this number is not what it seems. It is your code, your cipher, your path to escape. The numbers correspond to letters, but the answer is not revealed in plain sight.

Dial the numbers correctly, and you will spell out the word "EXIT." Each digit you input corresponds to a letter: 3 for 'E,' 9 for 'X,' 4 for 'I,' and 8 for 'T.' When you crack this code, the way to your escape will be unveiled.

## Fourth Game: Switches and Circuits
Your fate now hinges on your ability to manipulate an intricate electronic device, a mysterious contraption that holds the key to your salvation. The answer to your escape lies hidden in plain sight, but only the keenest of minds will decipher the message.

Before you stands a complex apparatus, a maze of switches and a mysterious knob. But fear not, for the solution is closer than you think. The combination you seek can be found among the intricate details of the device itself. Search the edges, the corners, the curves, and you will discover the answer in plain view.

For this challenge, every switch and the knob must be in the correct position. One wrong move, and you may be left in the shadows, with the message eluding you. Each switch and the knob hides a piece of the puzzle, a part of the code that leads to your escape.
